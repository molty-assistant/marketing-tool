title: Workforce scaffolding + first autonomous work order pipeline
priority: now
owner: molty
status: todo
worker: codex
repo: projects/marketing-tool
constraints:
  - No paid APIs (no OpenAI API keys, no Anthropic API keys, no Perplexity API usage)
  - Use subscriptions only (ChatGPT Plus via Codex CLI, Claude Code Max via claude CLI)
  - Use LM Studio only for local/free ops tasks
acceptance:
  - Add /workorders and /artifacts conventions to repo docs
  - Provide a simple script or instructions to run: Codex build -> Claude review -> apply fixes
outputs:
  - artifacts/WO-0001/summary.md
  - artifacts/WO-0001/claude-review.md

## Context
We need a lightweight way for multiple coding workers (Codex CLI, Claude Code) to collaborate without silos.

## Task
1) Add documentation into the repo describing the workflow.
2) Ensure it works locally on this machine.

## Notes
- If you need decisions, write questions to artifacts/WO-0001/questions.md and stop.
