    "Veo 2 best practices (Google official guide):",
    "1. One focused scene per clip — never chain A then B then C in one prompt",
    "2. Start with shot type: close-up / medium shot / wide shot / aerial",
    "3. Then camera movement: slow dolly in / pan left / crane up / handheld",
    "4. Then subject + action: what moves and how",
    "5. Then atmosphere: lighting, mood, style, colour grade",
    "6. For image-to-video: prompt for MOTION ONLY — don't re-describe the image",
    "7. Avoid vague words like 'beautiful', 'amazing', 'great' — be specific",
    "8. No quotation marks for speech — use a colon instead",
    "9. Use same seed across clips for consistent style",
    "Generate separate clips for each moment, then stitch if needed"
