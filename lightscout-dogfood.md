# Dog-fooding: LightScout AI Marketing Plan

## Purpose
Test the marketing tool with Tom's real app to find rough edges.

## To Test (when app is running)
1. Go to the deployed marketing tool
2. Enter: https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/lightscout-ai/id6748341779
3. Generate a full marketing plan
4. Try: Draft Generation (all sections, professional tone)
5. Try: Multi-language (Spanish + Japanese)
6. Try: SERP Preview
7. Try: Share link
8. Try: A/B variants

## What to Look For
- Does the scraper pull LightScout data correctly?
- Is the generated plan actually useful for Tom?
- Does the draft copy sound good or generic?
- Are translations genuinely localised?
- Any UX friction in the flow?

## Status
- [ ] Scrape test
- [ ] Plan generation
- [ ] Draft generation
- [ ] Multi-language
- [ ] SERP preview
- [ ] Share link
- [ ] A/B variants
- [ ] Write up findings

## Note
Need the app running locally or use Railway deployment. Railway URL for marketing tool is NOT mission-control — need to check which Railway project this deploys to.
